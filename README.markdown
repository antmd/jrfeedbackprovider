#JRFeedbackProvider

is a nonviral (MIT license) drop-in source code package which provides an in-application user feedback mechanism for Cocoa apps. It puts up a panel something like this:

<p align="center"><img src="http://rentzsch.com/share/JRFeedbackProvider.jpg" width="564" height="488"></p>

It supplies the panel (in .xib form), the Objective-C controller code and even the .php file to put on your web server to turn those web form posts into email messages (just replace `YOUR_FEEDBACK_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE@gmail.com` with whatever you want).

Requires 10.5.
